; This is test data for the UsersTest.php
; User data in this file are stored in the following manner:
; $userKey = $usersSecret_String
;
; The userKey may be the user's name or any random string (such as a UUID) which uniquely identifies the user.
; The user's secret may be any string, and is used in hashing data. It is never transmitted directly.
;
; When updated via api, only the top comments section is preserved. (An issue should be opened to improve this
; behaviour.)
testKey = test Secret string
moreTest = Secrets
